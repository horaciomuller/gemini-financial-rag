# RAG for Financial Information

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple Retrieval Augmented Gener ation (RAG) system using Spring Boot, PDFBox, and Google's Gemini model. Its primary goal is to provide answers to questions about financial information contained within a PDF file.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** The project leverages the PDFBox library to extract text from a PDF file, which serves as the context for user queries.
- **Gemini Integration:** Google's Gemini model is employed to generate responses based on the context extracted from the PDF and the user's question.
- **REST Interface:** The project exposes a REST endpoint (`/answer`) that accepts the question as a parameter and returns the response generated by Gemini.
- **Browser Access:** The endpoint can be accessed through a web browser by providing the question in the URL.
- **Terminal Access (curl):** The project can also be accessed via the terminal using the `curl` command.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Java framework for developing web applications.
- **PDFBox:** Java library for PDF file manipulation.
- **Gemini (Google):** Language model for text generation.
- **Jackson:** Java library for JSON manipulation.

```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Add the necessary dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.
4. Replace the `petrobras.pdf` file with your PDF file containing the financial information.
5. In the `application.properties` file, replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key.
6. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## How to Access

### Via Browser

Open your web browser and access the following URL, replacing `your_query_here` with your question:

```
http://localhost:8080/answer?question=your_query_here
```

**Example:**

```
http://localhost:8080/answer?question=What%20is%20the%20main%20topic%20of%20the%20PDF%3F
```

### Via Terminal (curl)

Open your terminal and execute the following command, replacing `your_query_here` with your question (remember to URL-encode it):

```sh
question="your_query_here"
encoded_question=$(echo "$question" | jq -sRr @uri)
curl "http://localhost:8080/answer?question=$encoded_question"
```

**Example:**

```sh
question="What is the main topic of the PDF?"
encoded_question=$(echo "$question" | jq -sRr @uri)
curl "http://localhost:8080/answer?question=$encoded_question"
```

## Notes

- This is a basic example of RAG. More advanced implementations may use more sophisticated techniques to improve the accuracy and quality of responses.
- The quality of the responses depends on the quality of the PDF file and the phrasing of the question.
- This project was developed for educational purposes and can be adapted for other uses.

## Next Steps

- Implement a more user-friendly interface to facilitate interaction with the RAG.
- Utilize more advanced information retrieval techniques to improve the accuracy of responses.
- Integrate with other data sources to provide more comprehensive information.
